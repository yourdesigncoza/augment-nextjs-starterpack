## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue tracker to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Bookshelf which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Bookshelf users.
