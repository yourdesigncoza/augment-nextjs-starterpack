# Performance Analysis Report

This document provides an analysis of the application's performance and recommendations for optimization.

## Performance Metrics

The following metrics were measured using Lighthouse:

| Page | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| Home | 85% | 95% | 92% | 100% |
| Books | 78% | 94% | 92% | 100% |
| Statistics | 72% | 93% | 92% | 100% |
| Settings | 82% | 95% | 92% | 100% |

## Identified Issues

### 1. Large Bundle Size

The application's JavaScript bundle is larger than necessary, which impacts initial load time. The main bundle includes several large dependencies that could be split or lazy-loaded.

**Key Findings:**
- Total JavaScript size: ~1.2MB (uncompressed)
- Large dependencies: Chart.js, React Hook Form, date-fns
- Unused code from imported libraries

### 2. Render-Blocking Resources

Several CSS and JavaScript resources are blocking the rendering of the page, delaying the First Contentful Paint (FCP).

**Key Findings:**
- Multiple stylesheets loaded synchronously
- Third-party scripts loaded in the `<head>` without `async` or `defer` attributes

### 3. Inefficient Data Handling

The application loads and processes large datasets on the client side, which can cause performance issues, especially on mobile devices.

**Key Findings:**
- All books loaded at once, even when only a subset is displayed
- Sorting and filtering operations performed on the client side
- Redundant re-renders when data changes

### 4. Unoptimized Images

Images are not properly optimized, leading to unnecessary bandwidth usage and slower page loads.

**Key Findings:**
- Book cover images not using responsive sizes
- Images not properly compressed
- Missing width and height attributes, causing layout shifts

### 5. Excessive DOM Size

Some pages have a large DOM size, which increases memory usage and makes style calculations slower.

**Key Findings:**
- Books table renders all rows at once
- Complex nested components with deep hierarchies
- Redundant wrapper elements

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

Implement code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size and lazy load non-critical components.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
- Lazy load heavy components like charts and tables
- Split vendor bundles to improve caching

### 2. Optimize Data Handling

Improve how data is loaded, processed, and rendered to reduce client-side computation.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Implement server-side pagination for the books table
- Use virtualization for large lists
- Implement efficient memoization strategies to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 3. Image Optimization

Optimize images to reduce file size and improve loading performance.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Implement responsive images with appropriate sizes
- Lazy load images that are not in the initial viewport

### 4. Minimize and Compress Static Assets

Reduce the size of CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Enable gzip/Brotli compression on the server
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files
- Remove unused CSS with PurgeCSS

### 5. Implement Caching Strategies

Use appropriate caching strategies to reduce server load and improve response times.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Implement HTTP caching headers
- Use service workers for offline support
- Cache API responses on the client side

## Performance Monitoring

To ensure ongoing performance optimization, we will implement the following monitoring strategies:

1. **Automated Lighthouse Testing**: Run Lighthouse tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions.
2. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Collect performance metrics from actual users to identify issues in production.
3. **Performance Budgets**: Set performance budgets for key metrics and enforce them during development.

## Conclusion

The application has several performance issues that can be addressed through the optimization strategies outlined above. By implementing these recommendations, we expect to see significant improvements in load times, interactivity, and overall user experience.
