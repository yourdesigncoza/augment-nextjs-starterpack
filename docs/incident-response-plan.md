# Incident Response and Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the procedures for responding to incidents and recovering from disasters affecting the Bookshelf application.

## Incident Response Plan

### Incident Severity Levels

Incidents are categorized into the following severity levels:

1. **Critical (P1)**: Complete application outage or data loss affecting all users.
2. **High (P2)**: Major functionality unavailable or severe performance degradation affecting many users.
3. **Medium (P3)**: Minor functionality unavailable or performance issues affecting some users.
4. **Low (P4)**: Cosmetic issues or minor bugs affecting few users.

### Incident Response Team

The incident response team consists of the following roles:

1. **Incident Commander**: Coordinates the response effort and makes critical decisions.
2. **Technical Lead**: Leads the technical investigation and resolution.
3. **Communications Lead**: Handles internal and external communications.
4. **Operations Support**: Provides operational support and infrastructure management.

### Incident Response Process

#### 1. Detection and Reporting

Incidents may be detected through:

- Automated monitoring alerts (Sentry, UptimeRobot)
- User reports via the feedback system
- Team member observations

All incidents should be reported immediately to the incident response team.

#### 2. Assessment and Classification

The incident commander assesses the incident and classifies it based on:

- Severity level (P1-P4)
- Scope of impact (number of users affected)
- Potential business impact
- Estimated time to resolution

#### 3. Containment

The technical lead implements measures to contain the incident and prevent further damage:

- Isolate affected systems
- Implement temporary workarounds
- Block malicious traffic (if applicable)
- Preserve evidence for later analysis

#### 4. Communication

The communications lead:

- Notifies internal stakeholders
- Updates users through appropriate channels
- Provides regular status updates
- Documents the incident timeline

#### 5. Resolution

The technical lead:

- Identifies the root cause
- Develops and implements a solution
- Tests the solution to ensure effectiveness
- Verifies that normal operation is restored

#### 6. Post-Incident Review

After the incident is resolved, the team conducts a post-incident review:

- Document the incident timeline
- Identify root causes
- Develop preventive measures
- Update the incident response plan as needed

### Communication Templates

#### Initial Notification Template

```
Subject: [INCIDENT] [Severity] - Brief description

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
```

#### Status Update Template

```
Subject: [UPDATE] [INCIDENT] [Severity] - Brief description

Status: [Investigation/Containment/Resolution in progress]
Impact: [updated description of user impact]
Actions taken: [summary of actions taken]
Next update: [time]

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
```

#### Resolution Template

```
Subject: [RESOLVED] [INCIDENT] [Severity] - Brief description

The issue affecting [affected functionality] has been resolved.
Root cause: [brief description of root cause]
Resolution: [brief description of resolution]
Duration: [start time] to [end time]

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
```

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Disaster Scenarios

The disaster recovery plan addresses the following scenarios:

1. **Data Loss**: Corruption or loss of application data.
2. **Infrastructure Failure**: Failure of hosting infrastructure or services.
3. **Security Breach**: Unauthorized access or data breach.
4. **Natural Disaster**: Physical damage to infrastructure due to natural disasters.

### Recovery Objectives

The recovery objectives for the Bookshelf application are:

1. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss is 24 hours.
2. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime is 4 hours for critical functions.

### Data Backup Strategy

The application implements the following backup strategy:

1. **Daily Backups**: Automated daily backups of all application data.
2. **Backup Retention**: Backups are retained for 30 days.
3. **Backup Storage**: Backups are stored in a separate location from the primary data.
4. **Backup Verification**: Backups are regularly tested to ensure recoverability.

### Recovery Procedures

#### Data Loss Recovery

1. Identify the extent of data loss
2. Stop all write operations to prevent further data corruption
3. Restore data from the most recent backup
4. Verify data integrity after restoration
5. Resume normal operations

#### Infrastructure Failure Recovery

1. Identify the failed infrastructure components
2. Activate standby infrastructure (if available)
3. Restore application and data to the new infrastructure
4. Verify functionality and performance
5. Update DNS or routing to direct traffic to the new infrastructure

#### Security Breach Recovery

1. Isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access
2. Change all access credentials
3. Restore systems from known clean backups
4. Apply security patches and updates
5. Conduct security audit before resuming operations

#### Natural Disaster Recovery

1. Activate alternate hosting location
2. Restore application and data from backups
3. Verify functionality and performance
4. Update DNS or routing to direct traffic to the alternate location

### Recovery Testing

The disaster recovery plan is tested regularly through:

1. **Tabletop Exercises**: Simulated disaster scenarios discussed by the team.
2. **Backup Restoration Tests**: Regular tests of the backup restoration process.
3. **Failover Tests**: Tests of the failover process to alternate infrastructure.
4. **Full Recovery Drills**: Complete simulation of disaster recovery procedures.
